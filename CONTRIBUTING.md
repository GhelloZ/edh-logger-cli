# Guidelines to contribute
All the work is done in the main branch, so you may fork it, make your changes and submit a pull request.
If it's a fix, please say so and remember to update both the version number in `metadata/version` by bumping the last number up by one and update `metadata/changelog.md` as well, this way i can directly push it to the releases branch and the workflows will publish the fix as a new release
If it's a new feature, please say so and list the new feature in `metadata/changelog.md` (or mark it as completed if it was one of the already listed features)
