## What's new
- [x] Added `version` command
- [ ] Added `deck add` command
## Fixes
- [x] Removed build from release workflow (uses lots of seconds and i'll probably simply add the package to linux repos so i'll leave the releases for who desires to build from source) (also technically not needed since you can simply clone from the releases branch but i wanted to learn about workflows and releases so i'll leave it there)
